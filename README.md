# This is a <a href="https://chingu-voyages.github.io/v11-toucans-team-19/">Chingu project</a> i like and i think is great for learning.
# Initially i just admired the project and could not replicate it.
# So i improved my HTML and CSS, then came back to rebuild it.
# I noticed it was not responsive, so i am trying my hands on making it responsive.
# As my skills improve i will continue to practice new skills here.
